# Yorkshire Art House

The Yorkshire Art House is a landing page for art enthusiasts, collectors and students who are local to, or visiting, Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Art House provides information about the artist, showcases some of her work and offers upcoming dates for exhibitions and art classes.

Users of this website will be able to access information about the artist and contact details on the Homepage, images of the art work on the Gallery page, and dates of exhibitions and classes as well as a sign up form on the Events page, which are all accessible from the navigation bar in the header of all pages. The site is targeted at people of all ages with an interest in fine art, landscapes and the Yorkshire Dales.

## UX

The website is made up of three main pages. Each page has a consistent theme, using the same header and footer, fonts and colour scheme across each one.

The landing page is accessible via the logo and the Home link in the header which is fixed to the top of all pages. The Gallery and Events pages are also accessible via their respective links in the header on all pages
